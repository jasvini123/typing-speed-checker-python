# Typing Speed Checker using Python (Tkinter)

The Typing Speed Checker is a desktop-based GUI application developed using Python and the Tkinter library. 
It helps users evaluate and improve their typing speed and accuracy in an interactive and user-friendly manner.

This project was developed as an academic course project and focuses on applying Python programming concepts, 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and GUI development using Tkinter.

## Features
- Random sentence generation for typing tests
- Calculates typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM)
- Measures typing accuracy by character comparison
- Displays total time taken
- Simple and clean graphical user interface
- Event-driven programming using Tkinter

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI library)
- time module
- random module

## How It Works
1. A random sentence is displayed to the user.
2. The timer starts when the user begins typing.
3. On pressing Enter, the application calculates:
   - Time taken
   - Words Per Minute (WPM)
   - Accuracy percentage
4. Results are displayed instantly on the screen.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or above
- Any OS (Windows / Linux / macOS)
- No external libraries required

## Applications
- Typing practice tool for students and professionals
- Educational project for learning Python GUI programming
- Foundation for advanced typing tutor applications

## Future Enhancements
- Restart button
- Highlight typing mistakes in real time
- Score history and leaderboard
- Difficulty levels
- Dark mode UI

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3.7 or above is installed
2. Open terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the project folder
4. Run the following command:

```bash
python typing_speed_test.py
